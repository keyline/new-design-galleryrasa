General Warranties: We are an independent organisation initiated in response to the urgent need to document and make accessible the multiple recent histories of art in the region. Through the course of time, We have collected a large body of relevant digital material which it describes, preserves, and makes available to the public at no cost via the Internet. We hold the information pertaining to these works but their respective creators or owners retain their copyright until the items lapse from copyright protection.

As an organisation that wishes to employ best practices, We respect the rights of the copyright holder(s) and have a series of policies and procedures in place to ensure their rights are not infringed upon through our programmes and functions by others.

                                                You agree that, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you specifically acknowledge that under no circumstances shall We be liable or responsible for harm or damages arising from your use of the information, facts, and opinions available on the service and the site or arising out of any action taken in response to or as a result of any information, facts, and opinions available on the service and the site. you hereby waive any and all claims against us and our subsidiaries, divisions, affiliates, agents, representatives and licensors arising out of your use of the service and the site and the information, facts, and opinions available thereon. You agree to assume responsibility for any harm or damages of any kind or character whatsoever resulting from these possible harms.

                                                some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of incidental, consequential or other types of damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you
                                                General.
                                                Applicable Law and Jurisdiction.

                                                Waiver. Our failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by us in writing.

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and us and govern your use of the Site and the Services, superseding any prior agreements between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
