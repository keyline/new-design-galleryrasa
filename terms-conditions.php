        <li>
            <b>General Warranties:</b> We are an independent organisation initiated in response to the urgent
            need to document and
            make accessible the multiple recent histories of art in the region. Through the course of time,
            We have collected a
            large body of relevant digital material which it describes, preserves, and makes available to
            the public at no cost
            via the Internet. We hold the information pertaining to these works but their respective
            creators or owners retain
            their copyright until the items lapse from copyright protection.

            <br><br>

            Because of the relatively short time period between the creation of the records and their
            retention at Gallery Rasa
            the majority of the collection is still covered by one or more copyrights. As an organisation
            that wishes to employ
            best practices, We respect the rights of the copyright holder(s) and have a series of policies
            and procedures in
            place to ensure their rights are not infringed upon through our programmes and functions by
            others.

            <br><br>

            We acknowledge that the creator, author or assignee of an original work retains the copyright
            for a fixed duration
            as set out in Copyright Act, 1957 ( as amended from time to time) or other applicable copyright
            law(s). These rights
            allow the owner to licence, grant, and restrict access to the work as well as the right to
            format the work across
            media including digitization. For us to make its collections available to the public it
            acknowledges it must do so
            subject to the terms of relevant copyright laws.

            <br><br>

            Where we retain the rights to public information / material we have accessed, we will ensure the
            material is made
            available to the public by the most open license as reasonably possible. Where the rights are
            retained by us and any
            third party, We have or will obtain the relevant permissions from third parties and signed
            authorizations from
            copyright holders before making the works available. To meet this commitment We have adopted and
            will licence the
            use of copyrighted works accordingly.

            <br><br>

            For works with no known copyright, or works where the rights holder(s) is untraceable (orphan
            works), we will make
            best efforts to locate and clear any rights subsisting in the work. If these efforts do not
            result in the locating
            of the rights holder(s), we will (in our sole discretion) decide if the work will be made
            available to the public
            and will take appropriate action in the event of any claim of copyright infringement.


            <br><br>
            All deposited works, with known and traceable copyright holder(s), made available through Our
            digital channels
            (website, applications, API, promotional materials) will have signed authorizations from the
            rights holder(s) giving
            us the right to make these available.

            <br><br>

            We will knowingly not distribute, modify, or allow unauthorized access to copyrighted works in
            its collection
            without the authorization of the rights holder(s).

            <br><br>

            On the lapsing of the copyright protection we will make the works available as in the public
            domain ‘without
            copyright’ protection. We will not assert any copyright through the acts such as digitization,
            migration across
            formats or platforms, or other ‘sweat of the brow’ measures which could create a new copyright
            in the work.
